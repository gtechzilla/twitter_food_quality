# twitter_food_quality
Hi there...
The objective of this project is to mine data from Twitter to check for the impact of COVID-19 on the availability of nutritious food in Africa particularly in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.

The code is a short one; we started with some few selected keywords, downloaded tweets, group by countries and then filter based on the change point in each country (before and during lockdown). Pretty much staright forward.
